PHYLOViZ Web Platform is a web-based tool for phylogenetic analysis. It is a modular tool that unifies both
[PHYLOViZ](https://www.phyloviz.net/) and [PHYLOViZ Online](https://online.phyloviz.net/index).

The PHYLOViZ Web Platform will allow users to access and perform phylogenetic analyses and visualizations from anywhere
with an internet connection, without requiring installation of software or access to high-performance computing
resources. The modular architecture will allow for easy integration of new analysis methods and tools, making it a
**flexible** and **extensible** platform for biomedical researchers.

The [wiki](https://github.com/bodybuilders-team/phyloviz-web-platform/wiki) of this project provides documentation of
several topics, namely archictecural views, deployment, authentication and the API definition (usage).

It was developed in the scope of a final degree project
for [ISEL (Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa)](https://www.isel.pt/).
